### 4. **Additional Instructions**

#### To ensure this project works well:
1. **Install `pyaudio` correctly**: 
   - For Windows users, installing `pyaudio` via pip might cause issues. You can download the precompiled binary from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) and install it manually using:
     ```bash
     pip install path/to/downloaded/pyaudio.whl
     ```

2. **Test Audio Input**:
   - Ensure your microphone is configured properly on your OS before running the script. You can also modify the `adjust_for_ambient_noise` settings for noisy environments.
